        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Our family has a rich history filled with love, traditions, and unforgettable moments. My family comes from Lamjung, and we are proud of our cultural heritage. One of the traditions we cherish is Dashain. These moments remind us of the values that bring us together, such as love, respect, and support.</p>
        <p>Over the years, we’ve shared countless memories that have shaped who we are today. It’s these little moments that remind us of the importance of being together as a family.</p>

        <h2>Family Memories</h2>
        <p>Today is the first day of our tour with the family. We started from Kathmandu at around 7 o'clock in the morning, heading to Chitwan by car. We had lunch along the way. Our destination was Sauraha, Chitwan, and the road we took was very dangerous. At one point, the dust was so thick we couldn't even see the road. The road was not peaceful, and our car was driving slowly. We reached Sauraha at night and stayed in a jungle resort.</p>
        <p>The next day, we had breakfast and lunch at the Elephant Reproduction Center, where we saw more than 40 elephants, including some baby elephants. We also saw tigers in cages and rhinos in the wild. Afterward, we visited the wildlife museum. Later, we went to Bishajari Taal and had fun with our families, before staying in the Power Hotel at night.</p>
        <p>The next day, we went to Lumbini, and in the evening we stayed at Power Hotel again. The following day, we went to Palpa and reached there by night.</p>
